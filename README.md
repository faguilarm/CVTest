# CvTestFam

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.4.

## Requirements and Installation

* A node/npm environment is needed to build and run the application. 

* Install the Angular CLI by executing `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

* Execute `npm install` to download project dependencies.

## Running API locally

The information displayed in the application is provided by an API created from a JSON file; you need to run the server included in the project with `node server.js`. The Angular project is already setup with a local environment (URL) to access the API.

## Local development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
